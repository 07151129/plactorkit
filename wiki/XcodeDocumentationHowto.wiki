#summary Subscribing to API Documentation in Xcode

It is possible to automatically subscribe to the Plausible Database API documentation directly in Xcode. To do so:

  # Launch Xcode.
  # Choose Help > Documentation.
  # From the Action menu in the lower left hand corner (the one with the Gear Icon), select "New Subscription..."
  # Paste the Plausible Database Xcode Documentation Feed URL into the New Doc Subscription dialog
  # The documentation should appear in the Doc Sets pane. If it does not, try restarting Xcode.
